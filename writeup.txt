Working features:
    1. Tiles are delt based on number of tiles remaining
    2. Tiles cannot be placed on any slot once the first tile has been placed
        - tiles after the first can only be placed directly before or after an already placed tile
    3. "Next Round" button stores off score and re-deals tiles to player
    4. Board cleared after each round

    I used a few globals to mantain the state of the program. This works fine for a small  website like 
    this, but for a more scalable option, a class should be used. 

Somewhat working (bugs noted):
    1. No slots on the tile rack, so the position when placing tiles on the rack is arbitrary (not a req)
Not working:
    1. Words arent checked to see if they are valid scrabble words (extra cred)
